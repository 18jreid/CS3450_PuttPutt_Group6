Usage Notes
----------------------------------------------------
- The purpose of the WebApp is to manage PuttPutt tournaments, and beverage orders from players/sponsors/managers. Sponsors 
are able to choose a date for which they want to host a tournement, and the managers will ahve access to all the funds and
stats of the specific tournament. Players are able to sign up for a tournament and enter a score at the end of their game. 
All users are able to order drinks from the Beverage Ordering System, and will be delivered to their desired hole. We've chosen
to use Django as our base framework, allowing the website to be easily hosted and tested.
